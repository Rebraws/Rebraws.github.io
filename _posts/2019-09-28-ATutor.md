A couple of weeks ago i was looking at the new online course from offensive security (AWAE) and it seems very interesting, but unfortunately i can't afford it because i'm only a student, so i decided to look at the [syllabus](https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/awae-syllabus.pdf), after reading it i decided to set up a local lab with all those apps and try to exploit them by myself, today i'm going to be writing about ATutor.

### ATutor 2.2.1 SQLI

I know that ATutor 2.2.1 has a lot of sql injection vulns but i will start analyzing CVE-2016-2555

*CVE-2016-2555: SQL injection vulnerability in include/lib/mysql_connect.inc.php in ATutor 2.2.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the searchFriends function to friends.inc.php*

So far we know that there's a SQL injection at the searchFriends function, but i want to find the vuln without using that information, so i launched burp on my local machine and start crawling the website to find interesting endpoints (see Figure 2.)
