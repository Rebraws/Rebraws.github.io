I'm a physics student and i'm interested in infosec, pentesting, RE, etc. I've been playing CTF's for a long time and now i'm starting with Bug Bounty

I want to use this Blog to write about old vulnerabilities, review old code and CTF's write ups


English isn't my first language so i'm sorry if there's any mistake :D
